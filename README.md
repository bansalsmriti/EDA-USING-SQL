In this project, we use a dataset call center, import it to MySQL Workbench, Clean it a bit then analyze it. At last, a visualization report on performance is prepared using Power BI.
The call-center dataset basically has over 32,900 records of data that describe calls made to various call centers. It includes the ID of the call, the duration of the call in minutes, the name of the person who called, their satisfaction score, and many other attributes.
I made this project with the objective of conducting a comprehensive analysis of multiple call centers to gain valuable insights from call data. By leveraging various attributes within the dataset, my aim was to evaluate and assess the performance of these call centers.
